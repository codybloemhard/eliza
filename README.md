## Eliza
On of those ergo in one piece layouts.
They tend to have short feminini names such as `Alice` and `Elise`.
The layout was inspired by the `Prime Elise` keyboard which is a very cute 40 percent layout.
I named mine after the Elise but I dutch-ified it.
- 40 key layout
- stabless
- 15 degree split
