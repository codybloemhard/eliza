## Eliza
On of those ergo in one piece layouts.
They tend to have short feminini names such as `Alice` and `Elise`.
The layout was inspired by the `Prime Elise` keyboard which is a very cute 40 percent layout.
I named mine after the Elise but I dutch-ified it.
- 40 key layout
- stabless
- 15 degree split

## Eliza stacked acrylic build plan
- Metal plate in middle (1.5mm).
- 8mm to edge of keycaps (2 x 3mm closed layer + 2mm top layer)
- 9mm space on bottom (3 x 3mm open layer)
- one 2mm base layer
- Elite-c v4 usb-c controller
- Handwired

## Need to find out:
- Bottom space possible with 6mm?
- How to mount ubs controller?
- Stand offs and screw config? With feet?
