## Eliza
On of those ergo in one piece layouts.
They tend to have short feminini names such as `Alice` and `Elise`.
The layout was inspired by the `Prime Elise` keyboard which is a very cute 40 percent layout.
I named mine after the Elise but I dutch-ified it.
- 42 key layout
- stabless
  - Stabs are useless: you press a key at a certain sweetspot, if a key is big enough for a stab it's wasting space anyway.
- 11.25 degree split
  - First it was 15 degrees but after seeing some Alice style layouts having 6 and 7 degree angles i compromised to 11.25.

## Stacked acrylic build plan
- 20.5mm thickness:
  - Metal plate in middle (1.5mm).
  - 8mm to edge of keycaps (2 x 3mm closed layer + 2mm top layer)
  - 9mm space on bottom (3 x 3mm open layer)
  - one 2mm base layer
- M2 standoff mounting:
  - M2x20mm 3.5mm outer diameter round standoffs
  - M2 flat top scews, 5mm long, 5mm wide(top)
- Elite-c v4 usb-c controller
- Handwired: tube-like manhatten style brass wiring
