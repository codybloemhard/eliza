# Eliza

On of those ergo in one piece layouts.
They tend to have short feminine names such as `Alice` and `Elise`.
The layout was inspired by the `Prime Elise` keyboard which is a very cute 40 percent layout.
I named mine after the Elise but I dutch-ified it.
- 42 key layout
- stabless
  - you press a key at a certain sweetspot which isn't that big
  - if a key is big enough for a stab it's wasting space: you will never hit outside the small sweetspot
- 11.25 degree split
  - First it was 15 degrees but after seeing some Alice style layouts having 6 and 7 degree angles i deradicalized to 11.25
